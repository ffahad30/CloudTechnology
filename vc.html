            <p>Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer separate from the actual hardware. It refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer system simultaneously.</p>
            <p>Virtualization is used in order to run applications intended for a different operating system while bypassing the need to switch computers or systems. It is also used to divide a large system into several larger systems so that a server can be used by several users or separated by different needs. Virtualization is also utilized to isolate the programs running inside of a virtual machine from the processes taking place in another virtual machine on the same host system.</p>
            <p>Containerization is defined as a form of operating system virtualization, through which applications are run in isolated user spaces called containers, all using the same shared operating system. A container is a fully packaged and portable computing environment. Containerization is used for its efficiency. It offers portability between different platforms and clouds.</p>
            <p>Unlike virtualization, containerization does not require the launch of an entire virtual machine for each application. Additionally, virtualization utilizes multiple operating systems while containerization only utilizes one operating system. Virtualization is better for applications that need an operating system’s full functionality while containerization is better for minimizing the number of servers you’re using for several applications. </p>
