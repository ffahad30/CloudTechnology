<h1>Data Centers and Cloud Data Systems</h1>

            <p>A data center is a physical facility that houses critical applications and data. A data center's design is based on a network of computing and storage resources that enable the delivery of shared applications and data. The key components of a data center design include routers, switches, firewalls, storage systems, servers, and application-delivery controllers. Meanwhile the cloud is when you store data on a different infrastructure. Essentially it is a remote version of a data center. The data can be accessed through the internet instead of on a local server.
            </p>
            <p>Data servers are best when the user or company wants full control over its management. However, data servers have limited capacity; a cloud data system has virtually unlimited capacity. The catch is that there is less control when using the cloud.

                    <p>When it comes to security, even though most believe that the cloud is less secure, with data centers the strength of security is dependent on the company. Your cloud data can be accessed by anyone with the proper credentials from anywhere with an internet connection. This is convenient, but it also opens a wide array of access points, all of which need to be protected to ensure that data transmitted through them is secure.

                        A data center is physically connected to your company's local network. This makes it easier to ensure that only people with company-approved credentials and devices can access stored apps and information. You are responsible for your own security, though. <a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4982-cloud-vs-data-center.html">(businessnewsdaily.com</a>
