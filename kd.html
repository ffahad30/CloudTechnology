            <p>Docker is a container file format used for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run in the cloud. It is the default container format. Docker enables you to build and run containers, as well as store and share container images.</p>
            <p>Docker offers rapid deployment, security, simplicity, speed and continuous integration. However, Docker does not provide cross-platform compatibility, is missing features offered by other containers, and does not offer efficient data backup and recovery.</p>
            <p>Kubernetes is a software that provides an API to control how and where the containers you have built in Docker will run. Essentially, it helps you run your Docker container efficiently by organizing multiple virtual machines and scheduling the containers to run on said virtual machines based on their resources. The containers are organized into pods, which are the specialized unit for Kubernetes.</p>

                <p>Kubernetes can improve your productivity, be cheaper than alternative solutions, and offer stability. However, it can be too complex at times, and can be difficult to adapt to if transitioning from a different software.</p>
                <p>Kubernetes and Docker are both containerization technologies. Both are also large open source projects, written in Go programming language, and use human-readable YAML files. Although, Kubernetes and Docker differ in several ways as well. While Kubernetes runs across a cluster, Docker runs on a single node. Kubernetes is more extensive than Docker.</p>
